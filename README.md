[PyData Ann Arbor](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-Ann-Arbor/) is a group for amateurs, academics, and professionals currently exploring various data ecosystems. Specifically, we seek to engage with others around analysis, visualization, and management. We are primarily focused on how Python data tools can be used in innovative ways but also maintain a healthy interest in leveraging tools based in other languages such as R, Java/Scala, Rust, and Julia. 



PyData Ann Arbor strives to be a welcoming and fully inclusive group and we observe the <b>[PyData Code of Conduct](http://pydata.org/code-of-conduct.html)</b>. 

PyData is dedicated to providing a harassment-free meeting experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of meeting participants in any form.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for PyData.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all. 



PyData is organized by NumFOCUS.org, a 501(c)3 non-profit in the United States.
